# How do I run it?
These projects were exported from the p5.js website, where you can develop javascript projects on the web with a visual interface. To run them, you can export the whole game folder (with html, js and css files) to your computer and open the index.html file.

# Ball Throwing

This project simulates the throwing of a ball and the prediction of the highest and furthest point, based on the movement. We assume, of course, there's conservation of energy on this game.

You can change the initial height, and manipulate the release angle and force, while seeing - at real time - the current movement equations.

It has some bugs though, like releasing the ball with angles different from the 1st quadrant.

# Snell's Law

This project simulates the refraction of light as it passes from a substance to another with different refractive indexes.

It has the ability to show the angles at which the light does not passes the substance aswell:

This happens when the refractive index of the destination substance is lower than the source.
